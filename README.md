## ShZO allles and the production of derivatives in F2 plants

### All F2 plants have have the zFPS/ZIS allele. F2-18 lacks the PI127826 allele of ShZO ZIS

### Epoxy-zingiberenol (9H10ZepoZ) is the only metabolite with a significant negative correlation (pearson coefficient) to whitefly survival

### BC1 genoypes were tested for whitefly survival (UvA) and the presence of zingiberene / derivatives (data Alain). Whitefly survival is not significanlty different between the groups (ANOVA)
